# quoteGram-react

The project I am most proud of to date. I wanted to test my React skills and ensure I have a solid foundation of how it works.
The plan was to replicate Instagram, allowing users to follow, and their feed to be automatically updated with their followers activity, have their own profile.
I chose to use quotes rather than photos so reduce the requirements for the backend, allowing me to store it all in a database and focus on the React side of things.

You can see this in action at https://aslan011.github.io/quoteGram-react/.
* Make an account and you will see an initial blank feed
* Headover to "Explore" and you can see profiles to follow
